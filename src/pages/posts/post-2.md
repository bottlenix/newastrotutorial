After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to try some more. I wrote and imported a small component from memory!

Still got it!

Going to add some code:

```
this is supposed to be code
10 PRINT "HELLO"
20 GOTO 10
```

Let's see how it renders

What if we define a variable called `navLinks` which we make an array?
